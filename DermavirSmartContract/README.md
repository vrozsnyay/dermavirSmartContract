## DERMAVIR Platform Overview

Dermavir is privately held clinical-stage biotechnology company focusing on the development and commercialization of a revolutionary new immune therapy platform for the treatment of chronic viral infections, cancer and allergy. Our technology is designed to boost specific immune response in order to modify or control presently incurable diseases. Our proprietary Vaccine Platform includes a given disease’s antigen specific plasmid DNA (pDNA), a nanomedicine formulation which encapsulates the pDNA to make it closely resemble a virus (we call this combination a nanoparticle), a topical (through the skin) administration device we call DermaPrep which delivers the vaccine via dendritic cell to lymph nodes of the immune system, and a software product which allows us to design antigen specific pDNA and closely match it to a patient’s genetic and HLA profile. The combination of these technologies supports the rapid and cost-effective development of original biologic vaccine products.
